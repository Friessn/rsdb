**Points** in a point cloud have **x,y,z** coordinates and associated **properties**.

From point cloud points structural indices can be calculated. Details to **point cloud indices** are located in the [RSDB wiki](https://github.com/environmentalinformatics-marburg/rsdb/wiki/Point-cloud-indices).
